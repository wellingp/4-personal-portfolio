                  <h2>About Me</h2>

                  

                  <!-- <p>I enjoy working with my hands and making things and, as a result, have found much success in fields that require some skill in a little bit of everything, such as web design.</p>

                  <p>Speaking of which...</p> -->

                  <h3>Where It Started</h3>

                  <p>In 2020 I decided to finally bite the bullet after considering web design for a long time. I needed a change and remembered how I used to enjoy and excel at making Geocities fan sites when I was a kid. I enrolled in a Continuing Education certificate course with <strong>McMaster University</strong> and have been studying and working on projects ever since.</p>

                  <h3>What I Do</h3>

                  <p>My specialty lies in <strong>front-end web development</strong>. From wireframing, to prototyping, to style guiding, to graphic designing - I feel most at home <strong>designing and building websites from the ground up</strong>, like a digital barn raising.</p>

                  <p>My style of design is based on a careful balance between <strong>retro and eccentric style</strong> elements, and modern web design trends. It is clean, subtle with colour, and effective. When working for a client, I approach in a similar way, instead striking a similar balance between their style and current practices. I believe that is my greatest strength which I bring to the party.</p>

                  <p>My dream stack includes the mastery of JavaScript and and some back-end development using node.js.</p>

                  <h3>At Home</h3>

                  <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy <strong>playing guitar</strong> poorly, wishing I could play <strong>piano</strong>, and struggling to decide which (human) <strong>languages</strong> I want to learn.</p>

                  <p>When I go outside, I go to concerts, take walks around the city, and go see movies</p>
