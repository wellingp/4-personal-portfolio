                  <h2>About</h2>

                  <p>Patti is an up-and-coming web designer and artist, born and located in Toronto, Canada.</p>

                  <p>After high school she attended the University of Toronto where she majored in French Studies. Following graduation Patti worked to gain experience in Administration while setting her sights on yet another pursuit: web design.</p>

                  <p>She then put her mind towards finding a way to combine all of the unique elements of her life experiences, skill-set, and various interests in a way that would bring a distinctly new flavour to the world of web design.</p>

                  <h3>Here's How</h3>

                  <ul>
                     <li>Life-long illustration and visual arts experience</li>
                     <li>Solid eye for graphics and design</li>
                     <li>A vivid imagination</li>
                     <li>Ability to take simple ideas and bring them to life</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Using these assets, she realizes the design that you have in mind.</p>

                  <p>In her spare time, Patti enjoys playing guitar, reading manga and Webtoons, studying languages, listening to music, and drawing while her pet rabbit keeps her company. She can also be often found at local concerts, at the movie theatre watching retro flicks, and taking long walks around the city's streets and parks.</p>
