# 4-personal-portfolio

## Project Details

### Project Start Date
02-08-2022

### Motivation

A digital portfolio of works in the style of 90s vaporwave.

This time around, I decided my next project should be a personal portfolio to showcase the best of what I've been working on and what I've learned. I tried my best to build most of it from scratch, so it isn't the flashiest, but is something which I feel represents me well and demonstrates what I can do without the use of frameworks. 

### Tech
Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Grid.

### Style Additions
Font Awesome, Google Web Fonts, images from Unsplash.com
