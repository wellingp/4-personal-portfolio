# 6-Spica
This project is a nod to early 00s Japanese blog aesthetic, inspired by the kinds of themes you used to see on Ameba and Yaplog.

Simple functionality has been added so that you can add a comment, toggle through entries, follow the blog, like a journal entry, or add it to your favourites.

## Technologies
Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
