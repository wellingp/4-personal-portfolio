                  <h2 class="h4 decorative-h2">Fertilizer</h2>
                  <p>Most soils are not able to provide all nutrients needed for your grass to develop thick, green, and weed&#45;free. We fertilize grass in order to promote leaf and root growth, and aid in recovery from foot traffic and pest damage. It also reduces and helps control weeds. There are two types of fertilizer, liquid and granular fertilizers, we apply either one depending on customer consent.</p>

                  <p>Lawn weeds such as crabgrass and dandelions pose one of the most persistent and annoying challenges in the great American quest to grow decent grass. The fertilizer we apply to your lawn is a combination of both fertilizer and weed&#45;control. As nutrients are released, the root system of your grass fills in any bare patches. This in itself promotes lawn weed control, depriving weed seeds of a place to germinate. Thus creating a beautiful, thick, green lawn.</p>

                  <p>Mulch is any type of material that is spread or laid over the surface of the soil as a covering. It is used to retain moisture in the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool, and make the garden bed look more attractive. Organic mulches also help improve the soil&#39;s fertility as they decompose. Wood chips are a very popular mulch because of their neat appearance, as well as their hardiness. We carry mulch in the colors Brick Red, Cedar Color, Chestnut, Walnut (dark brown), Beer Nuts, and even &#8220;New York Jets&#8221; Black.</p>

                  <h2 class="h4 decorative-h2">Grub Control</h2>
                  <p>One pest actually eats the roots of grass. Grubs, the larval stage of beetles, can appear anywhere in the United States. There are many types of grubs, but the ones which live in the dirt under grass are most likely Japanese Beetle, June Beetle, May Beetle, Black Turfgrass, Asiatic Garden, or some other regional beetle which lays eggs whose larva feed on plants. Grubs can vary greatly in size and live just under grass, usually 6&#45;inches to a few feet down. The result of which includes dead grass, plants and flowers.</p>
                  <p>Their presence also tends to attract all kinds of animals. Moles, armadillo, badgers, birds, mice, rats, voles, shrews, gophers, groundhogs, muskrat, opossums, raccoons, prairie dogs, skunks, and Snuffleupaguses are just some of the animals which will readily tear up and pull apart lawns in an effort to find grubs. Grub control will eliminate any potential problems and eliminate all the grubs.</p>

                  <h2 class="h4 decorative-h2">Overseeding</h2>
                  <p>Overseeding is an over&#45;looked activity in American home lawncare. Gardeners assume that fertilizer is all that is needed to keep a turf thick and free of weeds, but grass gets tired and needs to be revitalized every few years. Overseeding, which compensates for the natural slow&#45;down of turf's reproduction, is one of the most important lawn care tasks, yet few homeowners ever do it.</p>
                  <p>There are two major benefits to overseeding every three or four years&#58; First, you ensure your lawn stays thick and dense, or, if it has thinned, you can make it thick again. Thick grass has few, if any, weeds if it is mowed over 2&#45;inches tall. The second benefit is disease resistance. The new varieties of seed you sow this year will have better disease resistance than those already in your lawn.</p>

                  <p>To start new lawns, or even repair damaged ones, many people wonder which is better&#58; laying sod or sowing grass seed. While seeding is cheaper and offers a wider variety of grass types, many people are won over by laying sod. Laying sod is fast and produces high&#45;quality new lawns. In fact, laying sod is so fast, it's fair to say it gives you an &#34;instant lawn&#34;.</p>

                  <p>Drain tile systems serve two purposes: water removal away from the house, and water injection into the soil foundation during drought. Drought conditions can cause the soil of your foundation to shrink, causing the foundation and footer to fall. We come to your home and evaluate where drain tile is needed and how to pull water away from the wet areas.</p>

                  <p>Even with the best care available, lawns can thin out and lose color due to excessive thatch buildup, too much foot or pet traffic through specific areas that create hard or compacted soils, periods of high temperature, high humidity, or drought. Aerating and overseeing is recognized by turf experts such as golf course superintendents as the best treatment to control thatch, help reduce compacted areas, fill in bare spots, and revitalize growth.</p>
                  <p>An aeration treatment removes small cores of soil and thatch to allow air, moisture, and nutrients to penetrate down to the root zone. The cores brought to the surface contain micro&#45;organisms, which help the break&#45;down of the woody thatch tissue layer just below the lawn&#39;s crown. As the thatch layer is broken down, it is converted into organic matter that will then combine with existing soil particles. As the cores begin to break down over a period of several weeks the holes gradually fill in with a mixture of organic matter and soil, and the filled hole allows roots of existing grass plants to spread out and grow deeper, creating a healthier, thicker lawn.</p>

                  <p>Thatch is the build&#45;up of plant material between green growth and the grass roots which, although essential, can deter healthy lawn growth if there is too much. The best time to de&#45;thatch your lawn is just before your lawn&#44;s most vigorous growth cycle, from late August to early October, depending on your area. During this time the grass is growing vigorously and should recover quickly. De&#45;thatching in the fall is also recommended because at this time the weed seeds are not germinating and your grass does not have to compete with them.</p>
